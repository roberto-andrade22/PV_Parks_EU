# PV Parks in *dump* designated territories: A business opportunity

Roberto Andrade Martínez

**Introduction**

In light of the rising demand for electricity on a global scale, and the need for it to come from non-fossil sources as much as possible, one alternative to look at is renewable energy.

Given the space constraints to install a considerable capacity in most urban areas, one out-of-the-box possibility is to look at land already used for something else. Like, residual water plants, and landfills, among others. 

This project downloaded ten years of climate data from [Copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en) –the European Union Earth observatory– for two very different countries regarding their amount of sunlight: Spain and Germany, to obtain the energy potential of installing PV panels on land with a land-use designation such as dump.

Processing that data using Python, and in particular the library [Atlite](https://atlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), it is possible to obtain the PV potential if installing panels on land with a certain designation, such as *dump*, for every hour of the period of interest.

The project objective is to

- Demonstrate that such output is big enough to be financially viable and successful.

- That the total production is consistent from year to year.
