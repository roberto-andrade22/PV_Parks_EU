#PV Parks in *dump* designated territories: A business opportunity

Roberto Andrade Mart√≠nez

**Summary**

In light of the rising demand for electricity on a global scale, as well as the need for it to come from non-fossil sources to avoid carbon emissions as much as possible, one alternative to look at is renewable energy and, in particular, solar from photovoltaic panels.

Given the space constraints to install a consdierable capacity in most urban areas, one out of the box possibility is to look at land that has already been used for something else: like residual water plants, landfills, among others.

This project downloaded climate data from [Copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en) --the European Union's Earth observatory-- for two very different countries regarding their amount of sunlight: Spain and Germany, for a period of ten years.

Processing that data using Python, and in particular the library [Atlite](https://atlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), it is possible to obtain the PV potential if installing panels on land with a certain designation, such as *dump*, for every hour of the period of interest.

This project's objective is to 

- Demonstrate that such output is big enough to be financially viable and succesful
- That the output will be consistent from year to year, in order to guarantee both the aformentioned financial aspect as well as the strategic perspective for, let's say, a government who would like to invest in it to add around 1 TWh per year of energy to its grid.
